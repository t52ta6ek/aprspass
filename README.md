# APRSPASS.BAS
An APRS Passcode Generator

Generates the APRS-IS passcode given a callsign or string containing valid APRS-IS login characters.

This version of the passcode generator will actually warn you if you attempt to use invalid characters or a login string length that would be rejected by the APRS-IS system.

Written in GW-BASIC:

Will also run using PC-BASIC:

Can be easily ported to other languages.
